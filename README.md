### Agents
+ Agents are autonomous entities in computing and artificial intelligence that perform specific tasks or functions within a system.
+ They are designed to act independently, make decisions, and interact with their environment or other agents to achieve certain objectives.

### Applications of Agents
+ Automation
+ AI and Robotics
+ Multi Agents Systems

### Single Agents vs Multi Agent
+ Single Agent
  - A Single-Agent System involves only one agent that operates independently to accomplish a specific task or goal.
  - The agent acts autonomously, without interaction or collaboration with other agents.
+ Multi Agent
  - A Multi-Agent System consists of multiple agents working together, either collaboratively or competitively, to achieve 
    individual or collective goals.
  - These agents can interact with one another to complete complex tasks.
