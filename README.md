### Agents
+ Agents are autonomous entities in computing and artificial intelligence that perform specific tasks or functions within a system.
+ They are designed to act independently, make decisions, and interact with their environment or other agents to achieve certain objectives.

### Applications of Agents
+ Automation
+ AI and Robotics
+ Multi Agents Systems

### Single Agents vs Multi Agent
+ Single Agent
  - A Single-Agent System involves only one agent that operates independently to accomplish a specific task or goal.
  - The agent acts autonomously, without interaction or collaboration with other agents.
+ Multi Agent
  - A Multi-Agent System consists of multiple agents working together, either collaboratively or competitively, to achieve 
    individual or collective goals.
  - These agents can interact with one another to complete complex tasks.
  - 
### Types of Multi agents
+ Cooperative Multi-Agent Systems
  - Agents work together to achieve a common goal or set of objectives.
  - Cooperation is key, with agents sharing information and resources to optimize the overall outcome.
+ Competitive Multi-Agent Systems
  - Agents compete against each other, each pursuing its own goal, which might conflict with the goals of other agents.
  - This type of system is common in scenarios that involve competition for limited resources.
+ Collaborative Multi-Agent System
  - Agents collaborate to solve complex problems that are beyond the capabilities of individual agents.
  - Collaboration often involves negotiation, task sharing, and joint decision-making.
+ Distributed Multi-Agent Systems
  - Agents are distributed across different locations or nodes, often working in parallel without centralized control.
  - These systems are useful for tasks that require decentralized decision-making.
+ Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Systems
  - The system includes agents with different capabilities, knowledge, and roles.
  - These agents may have specialized functions and work together to achieve a broader goal.
+ Homogeneous Multi-Agent Systems
  - All agents in the system are identical in terms of capabilities, roles, and goals.
  - These systems are simpler to design but may be less flexible in handling diverse tasks.
+ Self-Organizing Multi-Agent Systems
 - Agents autonomously organize themselves without central control, adapting to changes in the environment or task 
   requirements.
 - The system's structure emerges from the interactions of the agents.

### Creating Automated Workflows Using Multi-Agent Systems
+ Identify the Tasks
+ Define the goals of the workflow which include optimizing resource usage, reducing processing time, or improving decision-making accuracy.
+ Determine Agent Roles
+ Define what agent needs to know and what actions it can perform. 
+ Assign specific tasks to each agent based on their capabilities.
+ Implement decision-making logic within agents to handle tasks.
+ Incorporate mechanisms for agents to handle errors, exceptions, or failures in the workflow.
+ Deploy the agents in the appropriate environment like cloud or local machine.
+ Continuously monitor and optimize the performance of agents.
+ If the workflow grows in complexity, scale the system by adding more agents or enhancing existing ones.
